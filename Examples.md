About the Examples

I've uploaded / plan on making examples to illustrate how to use my Python modules. I will add the necessary modules to each example in the blend file themselves to make it easy to just run the files and see the examples working.

However, it may be best to check-out and use the actual Python files from SVN, as they will be updated (as opposed to the versions in the examples, which may not necessarily be updated).
